## Steps to Google Services Integration (Calendar & Tasks):

This section of the application provides dedicated tabs for integrating Google Calendar and Google Tasks. Due to Google's security policies and the nature of embedding, direct full integration requires specific steps or API usage.

### 1. Google Calendar Integration
- The "Calendar" tab in the Google Services section uses an <iframe> to embed your personal Google Calendar. For this to work, you need to obtain a special embed URL from your Google Calendar settings.

- Steps to get your Personal Google Calendar Embed URL:

- Open Google Calendar on your Desktop Computer:

- Go to: https://calendar.google.com/

- Ensure you are logged into the Google Account that owns the calendar you want to embed.

#### Access Calendar Settings:

- On the left sidebar, find the section titled "My calendars". You might need to click the Menu icon (three horizontal lines ‚ò∞) in the top left corner to expand the sidebar if it's hidden.

- Hover over the specific calendar you want to embed (e.g., your primary calendar, or a custom calendar where you manage events/tasks).

- Click the three vertical dots (‚ãÆ) that appear next to the calendar name when you hover.

- From the dropdown menu, select "Settings and sharing".

- Locate "Integrate calendar":

- On the left-hand menu within the settings, click on "Integrate calendar".

#### Customize and Get the Embed Code:

- In the "Integrate calendar" section, you'll see an <iframe> embed code.

- Crucially, below this embed code, click the "Customize" button. A new page or pop-up will open with customization options.

#### Configure Display Options:

- Note: keep default view as "schedule"

- On the left side of this customization tool, you'll see a list of your calendars under "Calendars to display". Ensure the checkbox next to your primary calendar (and any other calendars whose events you want to see) is ticked.

- Note on Tasks: Google Tasks with due dates will appear on your main Google Calendar if your "Tasks" calendar is enabled for display in your regular Calendar view. The embed tool itself does not offer "Tasks" as a separate, distinct calendar to embed.

- Adjust other settings like the Default View (e.g., "Day" for a daily view), width, height, colors, and navigation buttons as desired.

#### Copy the Updated src URL:

- As you make changes, the <iframe> code at the very top of this customization page will update dynamically.

- Copy only the URL within the src="..." attribute of this updated <iframe> code. It will be a long URL.

#### Paste into your Angular Component:

- Open src/app/google-service/google-service.component.html.

- Locate the <iframe> tag within the mat-tab label="Calendar".

- Replace the placeholder src URL with the customized URL you just copied from Google Calendar.

<iframe
  src="PASTE_YOUR_LONG_CUSTOMIZED_GOOGLE_CALENDAR_EMBED_URL_HERE"
   style="border-width:0" width="100%" height="400" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"
  title="Google Calendar Embed"></iframe>

#### Save the file.

## Step-by-Step: change localStorage to IndexDB for data storage (It will give better features like )

### Key Considerations for IndexedDB in a Browser Extension:
 - IndexedDB is Asynchronous: All operations (add, get, update, delete) are asynchronous. We'll use async/await for cleaner code.

 - Schema Definition: IndexedDB requires you to define your database name, version, and "object stores" (like tables in a relational database). We'll define one object store for categories.

 - Wrapper Library: While you can use the native IndexedDB API, it's quite verbose. For Angular, libraries like ngx-indexed-db or dexie.js simplify interactions greatly. I'll use ngx-indexed-db as it's Angular-specific.

 - Browser Extension Compatibility: IndexedDB works perfectly within browser extensions. No special permissions are usually needed beyond what's standard for a web application.

#### Step 1: Install ngx-indexed-db

```Bash```
npm install ngx-indexed-db

#### Step 2: Configure IndexedDB in src/app/app.config.ts

#### Step 3: Update src/app/app.component.ts

#### Step 4: Update src/app//services/app-config.service.ts

#### Step 5: Create src/app/services/indexdb.service.ts

#### Step 6: Update src/app/my-list/my-list.component.ts

#### Step 7: Update src/app/short-tab/short-tab.component.ts

## üìä Size Comparison in Popular Browsers (2025 Estimates)
### 1. üì¶ LocalStorage Limits

| Browser                  | Per-Origin Quota   | Notes                                       |
| ------------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Chrome (Desktop)**     | \~5 MB             | Shared across tabs                          |
| **Edge (Chromium)**      | \~5 MB             | Similar to Chrome                           |
| **Firefox**              | \~10 MB            | Higher than Chrome                          |
| **Safari**               | \~5 MB             | Very strict and can clear on space pressure |
| **JioSphere / JioPages** | \~5 MB (estimated) | Based on Chromium WebView; likely 5 MB      |
| **Android WebView**      | \~5 MB             | Follows Chrome mobile behavior              |


‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** LocalStorage limits are enforced strictly. If you go over the limit, you‚Äôll get QuotaExceededError.

| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Chrome (Desktop)**     | Up to **6% of free disk space** or prompt user | Typically allows **100MB‚Äì2GB+**, depending on data and system |

| **Safari**               | \~50MB before prompt                           | User may get a dialog to allow more                           |
| **JioSphere / JioPages** | \~50MB‚Äì100MB (estimated)                       | Uses Chromium base, limited by WebView                        |
| **Android WebView**      | 6% of free space (same as Chrome Mobile)       | Behavior mimics Chrome on Android                             |
